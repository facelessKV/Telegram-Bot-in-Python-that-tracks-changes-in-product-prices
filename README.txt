   mkdir ~/price-tracker-bot
   cd ~/price-tracker-bot
   ```

2. Save the bot code from previous messages to a file `price_tracker_bot.py ` in the created folder.

## Getting a Telegram Bot token

For the bot to work, you need a special token, which you can get from @BotFather on Telegram.:

1. Open Telegram and find the bot @BotFather (Telegram's official bot for creating bots)

2. Write the command to the bot: `/newbot`

3. BotFather will ask you to choose a name for the bot - this name will be displayed to users. For example, "My Price Tracker"

4. Then you need to enter the username for the bot - it should end with "bot". For example, "my_price_tracker_bot"

5. If the name is free, BotFather will give you a token - a long string of characters like:
   ```
   1234567890:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ
   ```

6. Save this token - you will need it to set up the bot.

## Setting up and launching the bot

### Step 1: Insert the token into the bot code

1. Open the file `price_tracker_bot.py in any text editor (for example, Notepad on Windows or nano on Linux)

2. Find the line:
``python
   application = Application.builder().token("YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN").build()
   ```

3. Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with the token received from BotFather (along with quotes), for example:
   ```python
   application = Application.builder().token("1234567890:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ").build()
   ```

4. Save the file

### Step 2: Launch the Bot

#### On Windows:
1. Open the Command Prompt (Win+R, type cmd, press Enter)
2. Go to the folder with the bot (for example, `cd C:\price-tracker-bot `)
3. Launch the bot with the command:
   ```
   python price_tracker_bot.py
   ```

#### On Linux:
1. Open A Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)
2. Go to the bot folder:
``
   cd ~/price-tracker-bot
   ```
3. Launch the bot with the command:
   ```
   python3.9 price_tracker_bot.py
   ```

### Step 3: Checking the bot's operation

1. Open Telegram on your phone or computer
2. Find the bot by the name you specified when creating it.
3. Write the command `/start` to the bot
4. The bot should reply with a welcome message.

## Using a bot

After launching the bot, you can use the following commands:

- `/start' - Show the greeting and the list of commands
- `/add` - Add a link to the product for tracking
- `/list` - Show a list of all tracked items
- `/remove` - To remove an item from tracking

### How to add an item for tracking:

1. Send the `/add` command
2. The bot will ask you to send a link to the product
3. Copy the product link from the online store's website and send it to the bot
4. The bot will confirm the addition of the product and show the current price.

### How it works:

- The bot will check the prices of all added items every day at 9:00 a.m.
- If the price changes, the bot will send you a notification.
- The notification will show the old price, the new price and the percentage of change.

### How to run a bot all the time (so that it works 24/7):

#### Windows:
1. Create the `start_bot' file.bat` in the same folder with the following contents:
``
   @echo off
echo Launching a price tracking bot...
python price_tracker_bot.py
pause
   ```
2. Run this file instead of the command in the command prompt

#### Linux:
To automatically launch the bot when the system boots, run:
1. Create a service file:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/price-tracker-bot.service
   ```
2. Add the following contents to it (replace the path with yours):
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Price Tracker Telegram Bot
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=YOUR_USERNAME
   WorkingDirectory=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/price-tracker-bot
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3.9 /home/YOUR_USERNAME/price-tracker-bot/price_tracker_bot.py
   Restart=always

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
3. Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your user's name
4. Save the file (Ctrl+O, then Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X)
5. Perform:
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable price-tracker-bot.service
   sudo systemctl start price-tracker-bot.service
   ```

## Problem solving

### If the bot does not start:

1. **Check if Python is installed correctly.**
   - On Windows: type `python --version` at the command prompt
   - On Linux: type `python3.9 --version` in the terminal

2. **Check if the libraries are installed correctly.**
   - On Windows: `pip list | findstr telegram`
- On Linux: `pip3 list | grep telegram`

3. **Check the correctness of the token**
- Make sure that the token is inserted correctly, without unnecessary spaces

4. **Check your internet access**
   - The bot requires a constant internet connection

If the bot cannot determine the price on some site, it is possible that the site structure is not supported. In this case, try another store.
